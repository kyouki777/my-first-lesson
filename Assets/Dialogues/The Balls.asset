  - text: More balls.
  - text: These balls aren't just any ordinary balls.
  - text: They're a big part of your life.
  - text: You wonder what your life would be without the large amounts of balls the
      caretakers gave them.
  - text: Perhaps life would be dull.
  - text: To you, these balls scattered around the place each had a name and memories
      of its own.
  - text: You wish you could take them outside, but carrying them all would be a
      hassle since you need the torch light in your hands.
  - text: But know, you have to escape from this place as soon as possible.
  - text: You regret not learning more from your friends.
