  - text: This is Rian's bed.
  - text: Rian's face was very similar to Riri's. It often made you wonder if there's
      another kid that has a face like yours.
  - text: You frequently hear him sneak into Riri's bed at night with his pants wet.
  - text: Until now, you don't understand why he did that, but Rian was the strongest
      kid amongst them, he would always hit you if you didn't do your daily laps
      around the place.
