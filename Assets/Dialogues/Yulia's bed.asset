  - text: This is Yulia's bed.
  - text: Yulia would always scrape something on the floor with her nails until they
      were dripping with red water.
  - text: The caretakers replaced the floors every time she scraped something there,
      so you don't know what she was writing.
  - text: Other than that, Yulia was the one who created "words" so they could understand
      each other.
  - text: You wonder why the caretakers never allowed her to do that or touch the
      books around their place.
