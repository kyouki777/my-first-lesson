More balls.
These balls aren't just any ordinary balls.
They're a big part of your life.
You wonder what your life would be without the large amounts of balls the caretakers gave them.
Perhaps life would be dull.
To you, these balls scattered around the place each had a name and memories of its own.
You wish you could take them outside, but carrying them all would be a hassle since you need the torch light in your hands.
But now, you have to escape from this place as soon as possible.
You regret not learning more from your friends.
