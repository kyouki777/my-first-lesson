This is Beni's bed.
Beni used to play with you all the time. He likes to talk to you about what the outside would look like.
One time when they were eating, Beni asked the Caretaker if he could see the outside before getting adopted.
Caretaker stood up silently and dragged him into the naughty cage.
We listened to Beni's cries day and night.
Beni never spoke a word to anyone after that.
