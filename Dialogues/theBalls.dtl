More balls.
These balls aren't just any ordinary balls.
They're a big part of your life.
You wonder what your life would be without the large amounts of balls the caretakers gave them.
Perhaps life would be dull.
To you, [pause=0.5]these balls scattered around the place each had a name and memories of its own.
You wish you could take them outside,[pause=0.5] but carrying them all would be a hassle since you need the torch light in your hands.
But now,[pause=0.5] you have to escape from this place as soon as possible.
You regret not learning more from your friends.
