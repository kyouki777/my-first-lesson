You open a book filled with a list of names.
Some you recognize, and the rest you’ve never heard of.
Each name has a picture and red mark on it except for his.
You can't read, but there's a few recognizable words.
“......all children who can count…….immediately……who can read…….with playtime and candy until……all…..left….”
“Children who have escaped……causes = reading…..spreading to other children…….punishments for…..always come back later……”
The word punishment sends a chill down your spine.
You decide to stop reading.
