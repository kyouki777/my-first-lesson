This is Yulia's bed.
Yulia would always scrape something on the floor with her nails until they were dripping with red water.
The caretakers replaced the floors every time she scraped something there, so you don't know what she was writing.
Other than that, Yulia was the one who created "words" so they could understand each other.
You wonder why the caretakers never allowed her to do that or touch the books around their place.
