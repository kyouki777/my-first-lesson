This is the naughty cage.
The Caretakers have always been kind to them.
Even if they do something bad, Caretaker will never be mad or punish them.
But whenever they even mention going outside.
Caretaker will put them in the naughty cage for days until the kid collapses.
You instinctively step away from the naughty cage.
